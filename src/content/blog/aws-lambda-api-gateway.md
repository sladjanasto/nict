# Getting Started with AWS Lambda and API Gateway

AWS Lambda revolutionizes how we think about server infrastructure. Instead of managing servers, you simply upload your code and Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability.

## What is AWS Lambda?

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources for you. You can use AWS Lambda to extend other AWS services with custom logic, or create your own back-end services.

### Key Benefits:

- **No server management** - No need to provision or manage servers
- **Automatic scaling** - Scales from zero to thousands of concurrent executions
- **Pay per use** - Only pay for compute time consumed
- **Built-in high availability** - Automatic fault tolerance across multiple AZs

## Setting Up Your First Lambda Function

Here's a simple Node.js Lambda function that processes API requests:

```javascript
exports.handler = async (event) => {
  const { httpMethod, path, body } = event;

  console.log(`Processing ${httpMethod} request to ${path}`);

  try {
    let response;

    switch (httpMethod) {
      case "GET":
        response = await handleGetRequest(event);
        break;
      case "POST":
        response = await handlePostRequest(JSON.parse(body));
        break;
      default:
        throw new Error(`Unsupported method: ${httpMethod}`);
    }

    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(response),
    };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error);
    return {
      statusCode: 500,
      body: JSON.stringify({ error: error.message }),
    };
  }
};

async function handleGetRequest(event) {
  return {
    message: "Hello from Lambda!",
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    requestId: event.requestContext.requestId,
  };
}

async function handlePostRequest(data) {
  return {
    message: "Data processed successfully",
    received: data,
    processedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  };
}
```

## Integrating with API Gateway

API Gateway acts as a front door for your Lambda functions, providing:

1. **RESTful APIs** - Create REST APIs with multiple resources and methods
2. **Request/Response transformation** - Modify requests and responses
3. **Authentication** - Built-in support for API keys, IAM, Cognito
4. **Rate limiting** - Protect your APIs from abuse
5. **Caching** - Improve performance with response caching

### Creating API Gateway Integration

```yaml
# serverless.yml example
service: my-api

provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs18.x
  region: us-east-1

functions:
  api:
    handler: index.handler
    events:
      - http:
          path: /{proxy+}
          method: ANY
          cors: true
      - http:
          path: /
          method: ANY
          cors: true
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Cold Start Optimization

```javascript
// Keep connections outside handler
const AWS = require("aws-sdk");
const dynamodb = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient();

exports.handler = async (event) => {
  // Handler logic here
};
```

### 2. Environment Variables

```javascript
const config = {
  tableName: process.env.TABLE_NAME,
  region: process.env.AWS_REGION,
  stage: process.env.STAGE,
};
```

### 3. Error Handling

```javascript
try {
  const result = await someAsyncOperation();
  return success(result);
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Operation failed:", error);
  return failure({ error: error.message });
}
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

### CloudWatch Integration

- **Logs** - Automatic log collection
- **Metrics** - Built-in performance metrics
- **Alarms** - Set up alerts for errors or performance issues

### X-Ray Tracing

Enable distributed tracing to debug complex serverless applications:

```javascript
const AWSXRay = require("aws-xray-sdk-core");
const AWS = AWSXRay.captureAWS(require("aws-sdk"));
```

## Conclusion

AWS Lambda and API Gateway provide a powerful combination for building scalable, cost-effective applications. The serverless approach eliminates infrastructure management while providing automatic scaling and high availability.

Start with simple functions and gradually build more complex architectures as you become comfortable with the serverless paradigm.

## Next Steps

1. Set up your first Lambda function
2. Create an API Gateway integration
3. Implement proper error handling and monitoring
4. Explore advanced features like Step Functions for complex workflows
