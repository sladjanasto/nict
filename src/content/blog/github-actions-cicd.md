# CI/CD Pipeline Setup with GitHub Actions

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) are essential practices in modern software development. GitHub Actions provides a powerful platform for automating your development workflows.

## What is CI/CD?

**Continuous Integration (CI)** automatically builds and tests code changes, while **Continuous Deployment (CD)** automatically deploys validated changes to production.

## Basic GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: "18"
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
      - run: npm run build

  deploy:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Deploy to Production
        run: |
          echo "Deploying to production..."
```

## Advanced Features

### Matrix Builds

Test across multiple environments:

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    node-version: [16, 18, 20]
    os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
```

### Secrets Management

Store sensitive data securely:

```yaml
- name: Deploy
  env:
    API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
    DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.DATABASE_URL }}
```

### Conditional Execution

```yaml
- name: Deploy to Staging
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop'
  run: deploy-staging.sh

- name: Deploy to Production
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  run: deploy-production.sh
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep workflows fast** - Use caching and parallel jobs
2. **Fail fast** - Run quick tests first
3. **Secure secrets** - Never hardcode sensitive data
4. **Use marketplace actions** - Leverage community solutions
5. **Monitor workflows** - Set up notifications for failures

GitHub Actions transforms your repository into a powerful automation platform, enabling faster delivery and higher quality software.
