# Kubernetes Best Practices for Production

Running Kubernetes in production requires careful planning and adherence to best practices. This guide covers essential practices for security, reliability, and scalability.

## Security Best Practices

### 1. RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: developer-role
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods", "services"]
    verbs: ["get", "list", "create", "update", "delete"]
```

### 2. Network Policies

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: deny-all
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
    - Egress
```

## Resource Management

### Resource Requests and Limits

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      resources:
        requests:
          memory: "64Mi"
          cpu: "250m"
        limits:
          memory: "128Mi"
          cpu: "500m"
```

## Monitoring and Observability

Set up comprehensive monitoring with:

- **Prometheus** for metrics collection
- **Grafana** for visualization
- **Jaeger** for distributed tracing
- **ELK Stack** for centralized logging

## Deployment Strategies

### Rolling Updates

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
spec:
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 1
      maxSurge: 1
```

Kubernetes provides the foundation for modern container orchestration, but production success requires careful attention to these best practices.
